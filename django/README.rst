seaworthy-demo
==============
A demo of Seaworthy for my Docker/Travis blog part 3

This directory contains an example Django project. It doesn't do much and
nearly completely copies the `"Writing your first Django app" tutorial`_, with
a few changes to fit into the snack (cake/soda/chips/ice cream/etc.) theme I've
been using in my examples.

The Dockerfile and entrypoint script used here are a simplified version of that
available in `django-bootstrap`_ Docker image.
